Here the short sample how-to use Google C++ Test Framework in cmakeable projects

1. Google test will be downloaded from GitHub and built with your project

How to use:

1. git clone https://github.com/snikulov/google-test-examples.git
2. cd google-test-examples
3. mkdir build
4. cd build
5. cmake ..
6. cmake --build .
7. ctest -VV


Known issues:

- Google Test (master branch) was broken for MinGW (see https://github.com/google/googletest/issues/606)
  As workaround we'll use -Dgtest_disable_pthreads=ON as suggested per https://github.com/google/shaderc/pull/174
